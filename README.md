# Evaluating news NLP API

Here I have built a basic but functional app built on Express and Webpack.


## Get Up and Running

Fork this repo, then clone your forked repo down to your computer:

```
git clone -- git@github.com:[your-user-name]/webpack-express.git --
```

`cd` into your new folder and run:
- ```npm install```
- ```npm run build-prod```
- ```npm start``` to start the app
- this app will start the server, you can ofcourse edit port in server.js
